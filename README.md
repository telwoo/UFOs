# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The goal is to provide Dana with a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering for multiple criteria at the same time within the UFOs HTML we created. Once including the date, weâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape for more specificity.


## Results
There are multiple different ways the updated filtering will help users be able to navigate through the HTML created UFO site. To be able to perform the filter, select the date in which you'd like to run (1/1/2010 to 1/30/2010), input the city in which you'd like, input the state, input the country, and finally input the shape you're looking for. Once you enter these details, you'll be able to see (in real time) the search results. What's great about the search is that after you input the city, there will be a return list that appears. You also don't have to put in all criteria (state, city, country, etc.). You just have to fill in one and you'll get a return. See example below.

## Summary: 
Drawback
- One of the setbacks with this function is that it doesn't have a larger date range. This is a specific design within the data provided, but you'd have to update the dates.

Recommendations
- It would be wise to have a permanent refresher list, where the dates would have a range to instead of one speicifc date (and more recent dates, like 2022 timeframe)
- Recent updates to the header photo would be sufficient ansd vibrant.
